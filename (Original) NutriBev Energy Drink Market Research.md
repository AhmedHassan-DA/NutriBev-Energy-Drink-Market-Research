## Company Background

**Company Name:** NutriBev  
**Industry:** Food and Beverage (FMCG)  
**Product Category:** Energy Drinks  
**Market Presence:** NutriBev is a leading global FMCG company with a strong presence in over 50 countries. The company is known for its innovative and health-focused beverage products, including juices, flavored water, and energy drinks.

## Current Situation

NutriBev is planning to launch a new energy drink targeted at young adults (ages 18–35) in urban areas. The energy drink market is highly competitive, with established players like Red Bull, Monster, and local brands dominating the space. NutriBev wants to differentiate its product by offering unique flavors, natural ingredients, and a competitive price point.

However, the company is facing several challenges:

- **Unclear Consumer Preferences:** NutriBev is unsure about the flavor profiles that will resonate most with the target audience.

- **Pricing Strategy:** The company needs to determine the optimal price point that balances affordability and profitability.

- **Target Audience:** While the primary target is young adults, NutriBev wants to understand if there are specific sub-segments (e.g., students, working professionals) that should be prioritized.

- **Competition:** The energy drink market is saturated, and NutriBev needs to identify gaps in the market that its new product can fill.

## Business Objectives

- **Identify Consumer Preferences:** Understand the flavor preferences, packaging expectations, and consumption habits of the target audience.

- **Determine Pricing Strategy:** Assess the willingness to pay for the new energy drink and identify the optimal price point.

- **Segment the Market:** Identify key demographic and psychographic segments within the target audience to tailor marketing strategies.

- **Competitive Analysis:** Analyze competitor offerings to identify gaps and opportunities for differentiation.
