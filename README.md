3. **Assumption 3:** Missing values for certain questions were treated as "Not Applicable" or excluded from analysis.  
   * Caveat:* This could slightly affect the robustness of cross-tabulations.

4. **Assumption 4:** The survey was conducted during a single time period, capturing current market trends.  
   * Caveat:* Future changes in consumer behavior or market conditions may require updated research.
